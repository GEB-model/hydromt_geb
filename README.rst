What is the HydroMT-GEB plugin?
-----------------------------------

HydroMT_ (Hydro Model Tools) is an open-source Python package that facilitates the process of
building and analyzing spatial geoscientific models with a focus on water system models.
It does so by automating the workflow to go from raw data to a complete model instance which
is ready to run and to analyse model results once the simulation has finished. 
This plugin provides an implementation of the model API for the GEB_ model.

Why HydroMT-GEB?
-------------------
Setting up hydrodynamic models typically requires many (manual) steps
to process input data and might therefore be time consuming and hard to reproduce.
Especially improving models based on global geospatial datasets, which are
rapidly becoming available at increasingly high resolutions, might be challenging.
HydroMT-GEB aims to make the model building process **fast**, **modular** and **reproducible**
and to facilitate the analysis of GEB model results

How to use HydroMT-GEB?
--------------------------
The HydroMT-GEB plugin can be used as a **command line + configuration file** application, which provides commands to *build*,
*update* the GEB model with a single line, or **from python** to exploit its rich interface.
You can learn more about how to use HydroMT-GEB in its `online documentation. <docs_getting_started>`_
For a smooth installing experience we recommend installing HydroMT-GEB and its dependencies
from conda-forge in a clean environment, see `installation guide. <docs_install>`_
